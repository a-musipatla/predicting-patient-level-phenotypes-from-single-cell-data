# predicting-patient-level-phenotypes-from-single-cell-data
Deep learning approaches have seen increased use in several functional genomics applications, often meeting or exceeding the performance of state-of-the-art methodologies. Over the course of this project, we intend to use a convolutional neural network architecture to predict patient-level phenotypes from B cell mass cytometry data.
